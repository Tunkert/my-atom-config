# Terminal for Atom

Fork of [terminal-tab](https://atom.io/packages/terminal-tab). Changes made:

* Fixed bug where closing terminal on windows made atom crash.
* Terminal tabs opened from a text-editor will "link" the terminal to that editor.
* Custom texts can be inserted to "linked" terminals.
* Command to insert custom text can be called from both the terminal and the editor linked to the terminal.

A simple terminal for Atom that is based on the excellent [Xterm.js](http://xtermjs.org) and [node-pty](https://github.com/Tyriar/node-pty) projects. Works best with Atom 1.17 and later with support for Docks.
